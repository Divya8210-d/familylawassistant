Clean Generator Node - ONLY generates legal response

This node ONLY generates the legal advice response.
Reasoning analysis happens in a separate node (reasoning_node.py).

This ensures:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Response can't be contaminated by reasoning
- Generator is faster (no reasoning overhead)
- Easier to debug and maintain
